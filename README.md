I was inspired by https://github.com/ziteh/coppelia-sim-csharp-api and completed this framework with functions that are nessesary to control chains of the robotic manipulator, which uses force sensors. The hand of manupulator is hand-made in SolidWorks.
In order to run the code you need to put .dll file to C:\Windows\System32
