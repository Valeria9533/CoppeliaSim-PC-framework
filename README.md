I was inspired by https://github.com/ziteh/coppelia-sim-csharp-api and completed this framework with functions that are nessesary to control chains of the robotic manipulator, which uses force sensors. The hand of manupulator is made in SolidWorks.

In order to run the code you need to put .dll file to C:\Windows\System32
